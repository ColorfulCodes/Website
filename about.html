 <head>About me</head>

 <body>
   I am a Full-Stack developer. I have been programming for a almost two years.
   I began my journey with Python, and recently moved on to front-end technologies.
   Not only do I enjoy building things, but breaking them as well. I began my journey
   into programming because I wanted to be a hacker. One of those "bad-booty" hackers.
   I never planned to turn programming or hacking into a career, but I realized <thead>
  more I learned the more employeable i'd be. One day I'd be so good that I could freelance
  while traveling the world.
